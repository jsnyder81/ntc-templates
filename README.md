This is a fork of the networktocode/NTC-Templates repo.

The goal of this repo isn't to replace what they are doing.  But the need for some wireless specific templates outweights the requirements that they impose on the template process.

Specifically, the requirement that every line match.  While this does facilitate knowing that the template worked 100% of the time, it also creates some challenges with the time to market of these templates.  If you need to ensure data completeness from this parsing, these templates will not provide that.

As time goes by, I will try to get some of these templates to be *safe* and submit them back to NTC repo.  But as of now.  Currently I'm only adding templates for cisco_wlc_ssh and aruba_os.
